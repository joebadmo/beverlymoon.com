  lead: 'I\'ve worn contact lenses since middle school.',
  content: '<p>For over 20 years, I&rsquo;ve put them in every morning and put them back in their cases each night. Contact lens cases available in stores are junky, plastic, screw-top cases optimized more for travel than for home use.</p><p>With a product designer&rsquo;s discerning eye, I searched for an alternative that would fit in at home. Tired of the limited options, I took the initiative to design and manufacture my own contact lens case. I wanted an object that was easier to use, felt good in the hand, and complemented the space.</p><p>The result is a simple, modern case made of a beautiful material that refines an everyday experience. In 2011, I successfully funded the Moon Case on Kickstarter and it&rsquo;s still available today.</p>',

I led the creative direction and design of a range of modern smartwatch concepts that were flexible enough for male or female customers. We designed a rounded square shape with unisex appeal, buttons that evoked traditional watch elements, and an easy way to switch bands to fit the taste of the user. The result was a product flexible enough to be a fashion accessory rather than a tech gadget.</p>',
